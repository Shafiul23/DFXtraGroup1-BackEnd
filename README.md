# DFXtraGroup-BackEnd

## About

This is the backend of the full-stack application created at the end of the Digital Futures Academy. During this team engineering challenge, it was the task of the group to create a website called DFXtra where graduates of the academy could upload and edit their profiles so that clients of Digital Futures would be able to browse through.
